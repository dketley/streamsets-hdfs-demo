# StreamSets demo

You must accept the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE to use the StreamSets image.

This project provides a simple way to spin up [StreamSets](https://streamsets.com/) and a standalone [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) Docker containers. 
Linux, Windows and Mac are all supported. On Linux, the Docker containers are spun up directly. On Mac and Windows they are spun up in an Ubuntu 16.04 Virtualbox host VM. An example pipeline is provided, based on the [Taxi payments tutorial](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/#Tutorial/ExtendedTutorial.html#concept_w4n_gjt_ls). The data is outputted to HDFS running in the Hadoop container.

## Getting started

### Install dependencies

#### Windows / Mac only

* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Vagrant version 1.9.1 is tested.
* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). VirtualBox version 5.1.14 is tested.

#### Linux only

NOTE: If running on Ubuntu, you can install all these dependencies by running 
```
sudo host/install.sh $USER
```

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* Add your user to the docker group
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
* Test that docker commands can be run without `sudo`
```
docker ps
```

### Start Docker hosts

#### Windows / Mac

From the root of the project, run 
```
vagrant up
```
Note you will be prompted by UAC to agree admin privileges. This is so that your `/etc/hosts` file can be modified automatically.

#### Linux

From the root of the project, run
```
docker-compose up -d
```

##### Making HDFS download links work

If you wish to access the HDFS GUI from another machine, you will need to add a redirect in `/etc/hosts` for `hdfs` to your Linux host. On the computer you want to access the HDFS GUI from, add the following to your
* (On Windows) `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file
* (On Linux / Mac) `/etc/hosts`
```
hdfs <IP of your Linux host>
```

### Import the example StreamSets pipeline and run it

* Wait for HDFS startup to finish. You can verify this by checking that "Safemode is off" appears beneath Summary in the [HDFS GUI Overview tab](http://dketley1:50070/dfshealth.html#tab-overview)
* From the [StreamSets GUI](http://localhost:18630), import the pipeline in `examples/` and run it
* Navigate to `http://localhost:50070/explorer.html#/opt/files/destination` to see the output files.
  Note the output will be prefixed `_tmp_` while the pipeline is running. Once you stop the pipeline, the files will be renamed to `out_`. You can download them from here.

## Other bits and pieces

### (Windows / Mac only) Accessing the Ubuntu host

* To SSH into the host VM, run
```
vagrant ssh
```

### To add a new StreamSets package

* From within the StreamSets app, navigate to Package Manager
* Copy the library name you want
* Uncomment out the relevant `build` lines in `docker-compose.yml`
* Comment out the `sdc` `image` line in `docker-compose.yml`
* Add the library name to `PACKAGES_TO_INSTALL` in `docker-compose.yml`
* From the Linux host, run
```
docker-compose stop sdc
docker-compose rm --force sdc
docker-compose build sdc
docker-compose up -d sdc
```
